## Introduction to Cloud

### **Agenda**

#### 1. What is Cloud Computing ?
#### 2. Introduction to AWS 



#### What is Cloud Computing ?

According to the official NIST definition, "cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous ( global \ universal ) , convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction." 

#### Cloud Service Model 

* Software as a Service (SSAS)
* Platform as a Service (PaaS)
* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Cloud service model is derived from how we used to manage data centers and shared responsibility looks like -

#### Colocation centre 

A colocation centre or "carrier hotel", is a type of data centre where equipment, space, and bandwidth are available for rental to retail customers.

##### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Infrastructure as a Service, sometimes abbreviated as IaaS, contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. Infrastructure as a Service provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.

##### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Platforms as a service remove the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allow you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you donâ€™t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.

##### Software as a Service (SaaS)

Software as a Service provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to end-user applications. With a SaaS offering you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece software. A common example of a SaaS application is web-based email where you can send and receive email without having to manage feature additions to the email product or maintaining the servers and operating systems that the email program is running on.
